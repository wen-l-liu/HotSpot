# HotSpot

## Overview
HotSpot is a Django-based web application designed for hot sauce enthusiasts to discover, review, and shop for a curated selection of hot sauces. The platform combines a modern, responsive design (using Bootstrap 5) with robust user features, including authentication, product reviews, and admin management. The site holds a Products page with a collection of items with reviews, and a Blogs page with user created blogs for hot sauce related content like recipes. Product Reviews and Blog comments has full CRUD functionality, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete reviews efficiently.

### Design Rationale:
The layout emphasises simplicity and clarity, with Bootstrap 5 ensuring a responsive experience across devices. The color palette and typography were chosen for readability and accessibility, following WCAG guidelines.
Accessibility features include keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support.

#### Fonts selection
I used Google Fonts to pick my fonts.
Primary font is - Lexend for main website text.
Secondary font is - Hammersmith One for logo brand font.

#### Colours ####

The primary colour theme for HotSpot is red, reflecting the heat and excitement associated with hot sauces. Red is energetic, eye-catching, and immediately communicates the spicy nature of the products. To provide visual contrast and highlight positive actions (such as success messages or confirmation buttons), green is used sparinglyâ€”this contrast draws attention to important interactive elements without overwhelming the user.

A mostly white background with black text is used throughout the site for simplicity and maximum readability. This clean, minimal approach ensures that content remains the focus, and that the vibrant red and green accents stand out effectively for calls to action and key feedback.

### Reasoning For Any Final Changes:
User feedback led to improvements in navigation flow, review visibility, and mobile responsiveness. Adjustments were made to enhance inclusivity and overall user satisfaction.



### Agile
This project was developed using an agile methodology, focusing on iterative and incremental progress. I began by building the core navigation and implementing essential user authentication features such as login and sign-up, ensuring users could access and interact with the site from the start.
Next, I added the product catalogue, allowing users to browse and view detailed information about each hot sauce. Once the product functionality was stable, I introduced the review system, enabling users to share feedback and rate products. After establishing these core features, I expanded the site with an About page to provide background information, and finally, I implemented the blog section to foster community engagement and share hot sauce-related content. Each feature was tested and refined in cycles, with feedback and validation guiding continuous improvement throughout the development process.

I used [GitHub Projects Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/wen-l-liu/projects/10) to track my progress and to add tasks.

### HTML Validation
HTML was first checked using Copilot in VS Code, then deployed to Heroku so that the URL could be run through the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
Only minor issues occurred due to apostrophes in product names causing parse errors, added |escape to product.name.
Blog articles had errors as cripsy froms applied alot of extra HTML tags and CSS in the HTML pageload, I removed the form content stylings and passed the test.

### Accessibilty evaluation
The [WAVE Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used throughout development to identify and resolve accessibility issues. WAVE helped highlight missing or incorrect ARIA labels, insufficient color contrast, and improper heading structure. All pages were tested and iteratively improved based on WAVEâ€™s feedback to ensure the site is accessible to users with disabilities.

**Semantic Heading Levels:**
During validation, heading levels were reviewed and adjusted for semantic correctness, also addressed WAVE warnings about missing or skipped heading levels
**Colour Palette Adjustments:**
The original palette included an orange accent, but this was removed after WAVE flagged low contrast with white backgrounds.
The final palette uses red as the primary accent, with green for positive actions.
**Fieldsets and Legends**
For filters in the product page, there were WAVE warnings about missing fieldsets and legends, all filter groups in forms (such as brand, heat, and flavour profile filters) are wrapped in fieldset elements with a visually hidden legend so as to not conflict with exisiting stylings. Remain accessible to screen readers but is not visible to sighted users.

### Light House
Lighthouse reports showed generally strong results for the site, with performance, accessibility, and SEO scores consistently in the 90s on desktop. Best Practices averaged in the 80s, with minor recommendations for improvement. On mobile devices, performance scores were slightly lower, typically in the high 70s, due to increased resource demands. Overall, the site delivers a fast, accessible, and well-optimised experience across platforms.

  - Copilot accelerated the creation of Django models, views, and forms, suggesting best practices and efficient patterns. It was especially helpful for generating boilerplate code and exploring alternative approaches.
- **Data Creation:**
  - Copilot was just to generate json to populate comments and review models.
- **Debugging:**
  - Copilot provided insightful suggestions for resolving errors and simplifying complex logic.
- **Performance and UX Optimisation:**
  - The AI suggested impactful Bootstrap tweaks, improving the visual polish and responsiveness of the site.
  - Copilot assisted in optimising and simplifying my Django view functions, suggesting efficient query patterns and helping to minimise unnecessary database calls for faster performance.
- **Automated Unit Testing:**
  - Copilot assisted in generating initial test cases, helping to cover edge cases and improve the robustness of the application.


## Future Enhancements
