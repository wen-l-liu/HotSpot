# HotSpot

## Overview
HotSpot is a Django-based web application designed for hot sauce enthusiasts to discover, review, and shop for a curated selection of hot sauces. The platform combines a modern, responsive design (using Bootstrap 5) with robust user features, including authentication, product reviews, and admin management. The site holds a Products page with a collection of items with reviews, and a Blogs page with user created blogs for hot sauce related content like recipes. Product Reviews and Blog comments has full CRUD functionality, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete reviews efficiently.

### Wireframes:
Wireframes were created to ensure intuitive navigation, clear product presentation, and accessibility for all users.
Here are wireframes for all the pages of the website.

### Design Rationale:
The layout emphasises simplicity and clarity, with Bootstrap 5 ensuring a responsive experience across devices. The color palette and typography were chosen for readability and accessibility, following WCAG guidelines.
Accessibility features include keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support.

#### Fonts selection
I used Google Fonts to pick my fonts.
Primary font is - Lexend for main website text.
Secondary font is - Hammersmith One for logo brand font.

#### Colours ####

The primary colour theme for HotSpot is red, reflecting the heat and excitement associated with hot sauces. Red is energetic, eye-catching, and immediately communicates the spicy nature of the products. To provide visual contrast and highlight positive actions (such as success messages or confirmation buttons), green is used sparinglyâ€”this contrast draws attention to important interactive elements without overwhelming the user.

A mostly white background with black text is used throughout the site for simplicity and maximum readability. This clean, minimal approach ensures that content remains the focus, and that the vibrant red and green accents stand out effectively for calls to action and key feedback.

### Reasoning For Any Final Changes:
User feedback led to improvements in navigation flow, review visibility, and mobile responsiveness. Adjustments were made to enhance inclusivity and overall user satisfaction.

## Key Features

- **Product Catalogue:** Browse, filter, and search a wide range of hot sauces by category or brand.
- **Product Detail Pages:** View detailed information, images, and reviews for each sauce.
- **User Authentication:** Register, log in securely.
- **Product Reviews:** Leave and read reviews to help the community make informed choices.
- **Admin Management:** Admins can add, edit, or remove products, manage categories, and moderate reviews.
- **Notifications:** Users receive feedback on actions (e.g., successful login, review submission).
- **Inclusivity Notes:** Accessibility features include ARIA labels, alt text for images, and keyboard navigation.

## Deployment

- **Platform:** Heroku (or your chosen platform)
- **High-Level Deployment Steps:**
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Set up the environment with PostgreSQL (or your chosen database).
  3. Configure environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., secret keys, API keys).
  4. Deploy using Heroku Git, GitHub integration, or your preferred method.
- **Verification and Validation:**
  - The deployed application was tested for consistent functionality, design, and accessibility using tools like Lighthouse and manual testing.
- **Security Measures:**
  - Sensitive data is stored in environment variables.
  - DEBUG mode is disabled in production for enhanced security.

## AI Implementation

### Use Cases and Reflections

Throughout the development of HotSpot, GitHub Copilot was used to streamline coding, debugging, and testing.

- **Code Creation:**
  - Copilot accelerated the creation of Django models, views, and forms, suggesting best practices and efficient patterns. It was especially helpful for generating boilerplate code and exploring alternative approaches.
- **Data Creation:**
  - Copilot was just to generate json to populate comments and review models.
- **Debugging:**
  - Copilot provided insightful suggestions for resolving errors and simplifying complex logic.
- **Performance and UX Optimisation:**
  - The AI suggested impactful Bootstrap tweaks, improving the visual polish and responsiveness of the site.
  - Copilot assisted in optimising and simplifying my Django view functions, suggesting efficient query patterns and helping to minimise unnecessary database calls for faster performance.
- **Automated Unit Testing:**
  - Copilot assisted in generating initial test cases, helping to cover edge cases and improve the robustness of the application.

### Overall Impact

Using Copilot transformed the workflow, reducing the time taken for ideas to move from the brain to the machine. While not every suggestion was perfect, the AI served as a valuable collaborator, enhancing both technical and problem-solving skills.

### HTML Validation
HTML was first checked using Copilot in VS Code, then deployed to Heroku so that the URL could be run through the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
Only minor issues occurred due to apostrophes in product names causing parse errors, added |escape to product.name.
Blog articles had errors as cripsy froms applied alot of extra HTML tags and CSS in the HTML pageload, I removed the form content stylings and passed the test.
